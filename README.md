# Space Rangers
This is a little game created with [Godot 3](https://godotengine.org/)
The goal of this game is to dodge enemies going from the top of the screen as long as you can.

## How to play
Move your ship with **left and right arrows**. You can't move vertically.
You can switch the color of your ship from **Red** to **Green** with **Space**.
Enemies are **Red** of **Green**. **You can destroy enemies only if you got the same color.**

There is two bonus items :
* **Thunder** : add **speed** to the ship. This is automatic.
* **POW Box** : add a **bomb** to destroy every ship on the screen. Use the **bomb** with **Ctrl**.

## Scoring
* 10 points every time you collide with a ship.<br />
* 5 points every time a ship go away without collided you.<br />
* 100 points when you get a speed bonus<br />
*  That's all !
